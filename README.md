# SimpleTB
This is a app that replaces your taskbar and creates a topbar with a simple design. It is made with Tauri and React.
Currently it is only available for Windows and ins't planned to be available for other OS.
The app is still in development and is not fully functional yet and still has some bugs.
If you want to contribute to the project, feel free to open a pull request or an issue.

## How to run
To run the app you need to have Node.js installed on your computer. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).
After you have installed Node.js, you can clone the repository and run the following commands:
```bash
npm install
npm run tauri dev
```
This will start the app in development mode.

## How to build
To build the app you can run the following command:
```bash
npm run tauri build
```
This will create a folder called `target` with the built app at `src-tauri`.
